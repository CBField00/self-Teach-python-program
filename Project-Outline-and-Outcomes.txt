The point of the program is to create a small learning application, using python, to help learn the language.
The aim of it is to use a basic syntax checker for any input code that the user inputs to help identify where they went wrong, allowing
an interactive learning tool.



Key Project Components:

- Be able to teach python as accurately as possible with the basic concepts
    - Data Types
        - Strings
        - Integers
        - Floats
        - Booleans
        - Character

            - Implicit and Explicit Switiching between Datatypes
                - Using str, int, bool, float and chr
                - being able to switch between the str and int datatypes, for mathematical operations.


    - Operations
        - Addition (+)
        - Subtraction (-)
        - Multiplication (*)
        - Division (/)
        - Modulus (%)
        - Exponent (**)
        - Floor Division (//)
        - Not Equal to (<>)
            - NOTE THIS IS SIMILAR TO != HOWEVER IT WILL RETURN A BOOLEAN PRODUCT



    - Conditions and Boolean conditionals
        - If statements
        - elif branches
        - if and else statements and trees

        using an if, elif and else tree s

        - while statements

        - Nesting Conditions

        - The same as or equal to (==)
        - Not the same as or equal to (!=)
        - Less than or equal to (<=)
        - Greater than or equal to (>=)

    - Functions
        - Defining Functions
        - The Reason for having functions
        - parenthesis

    - importing modules
        - using import and from ""module"" import*
        - useful modules
